# ProtoLogic BGen
Un-official protologic bindings generator.

### Supports
Rust - [Protologic/Protologic.rs](https://github.com/Protologic/Protologic.rs) (Not used by this repo, yet?)  
Lua - [Avril112113/???](https://github.com/Dude112113/) (Repo not yet available)  
C/C++ - [Avril112113/???](https://github.com/Dude112113/) (Repo not yet available)  

### Updating the bindings
Currently, `protologic_bindings.json` is manually managed.  
Once `protologic_bindings.json` is updated, run `python main.py` with Python 3.10.  
Bindings in `./out` will be updated.
